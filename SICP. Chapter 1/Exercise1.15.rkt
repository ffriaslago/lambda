; b) (sine a). Order of growth in space and number of steps
; The angle a is divided by 3 every time p is applied, so the iteration stops if a/3^n<0.1 being n the number of steps
; Then, solving for n
; a/0.1 < 3^n
; log(a)-log(0.1) < nÂ·log(3)
; n > (log(a)-log(0.1))/log(3)
; Since in this procedure, the order of growth in space and number of steps is the same, both relationed to n.
; It can be seen that both of them are O(log(a))
