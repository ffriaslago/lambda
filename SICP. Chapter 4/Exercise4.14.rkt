; map is a procedure that takes as arguments a procedure and a list

; list is the same in the Lisp system or in the metacircular Lisp, but it doesn't happen the same with procedures

; Eva Lu Ator version of map uses as argument a procedure defined in the metacircular evaluator

; Louis Reasoner version uses as argument a procedure defined in the Lisp system, but it receives a procedure defined in the metacircular evaluator
