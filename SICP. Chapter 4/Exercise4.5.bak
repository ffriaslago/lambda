; Remainder: assoc procedure. Arguments are a key and a list of records. Assoc returns the record that has the given key as its car
; (assoc 'b '((a 1) (b 2))) returns (b 2)

(cond ((assoc 'b '((a 1) (b 2))) => cadr)
      (else false))

; Here, test is (assoc 'b '((a 1) (b 2))), which returns (b 2), which is a true value
