README.md

* Repository on structured programming. It contains a set of exercises done through the work of a bachelor thesis to obtain a Mathematics degree in Universidad de Cantabria.

* The difference between the extension \textit{rkt} and \textit{bak} files is that the former ones contain the proper exercise while the latter contain a recovery version of it, usually not a full one, so there is no point of paying attention to them, as they normally contain an incomplete or more simple version of the same exercises. It can be noticed too that, although it was tried to do most of them with the \textit{DrRacket} editor, some of the exercises are in a PDF format for a better visualisation.
