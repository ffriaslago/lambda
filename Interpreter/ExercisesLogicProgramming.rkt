; Exercise 4.59

; c)

(meeting-time (Hacker Alyssa P) (Wednesday ?time))

; Exercise 4.60
;
; Because of the definition of the rule lives-near, both answers are different and both fulfill the conditions asked
; It could be added a rule for ordering the names of the people in a way that there is only one possibility for each answer

; Logic as programs
;
; Exercise 4.61
;
; (?x next-to ?y in (1 (2 3) 4))

((2 3) next-to 4 in (1 (2 3) 4))
(1 next-to (2 3) in (1 (2 3) 4))

; (?x next-to 1 in (2 1 3 1))

(2 next-to 1 in (2 1 3 1))
(3 next-to 1 in (2 1 3 1))

; Exercise 4.62

; (last-pair (3) ?x) should return (last-pair (3) (3))
; (last-pair (1 2 3) ?x) should return (last-pair (1 2 3) (3))
; (last-pair (2 ?x) (3)) should return (last-pair (2 3) (3))
; (last-pair ?x (3)) could return any list having as last element 3. Infinite solutions.

(rule (last-pair (?x) (?x)))

(rule (last-pair (?u . ?v) (?x))
      (last-pair ?v (?x)))
      

; Exercise 4.63

; son assertions follow (son ?father ?son)
; wife assertions follow (wife ?husband ?wife)

(rule (father ?sonn ?fatherr)
      (or (son ?fatherr ?sonn)
          (and (wife ?fatherr ?mom)

(rule (grandson ?grandf ?grands)
      (and (father ?grands ?fatherr)
           (father ?fatherr ?grandf)))

; Exercise 4.64

(rule (outranked-by ?staff-person ?boss)
  (or (supervisor ?staff-person ?boss)
      (and (outranked-by ?middle-manager ?boss)
           (supervisor ?staff-person ?middle-manager))))

(outranked-by (Bitdiddle Ben) ?who)

; or queries are unified in parallel
; query (outranked-by ?middle-manager ?who) -> Infinite loop, as ?middle-manager is unbound
