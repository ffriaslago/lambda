; The objective is to add the absolute value of b to a.
; Then, if b>0, the operator + is used with a and b.
; If b<=0, it is used the operator -, placed as the alternative clause in the conditional if, resulting in the substraction of a negative value, i.e., the addition of a positive value.
; The goal is achieved
