% (a) point( A, B)=point( 1, 2). Successful. The resulting instation is:
% A = 1
% B = 2

% (b) point( A, B)=point( X, Y, Z). Not successful. Both are structures, but clause (b)
% is not fulfilled as not all their components match.

% (c) plus( 2, 2) = 4. Not succesful. Left side is a structure, right side a constant.

% (d) +( 2, D) = +( E, 2). Successful. The resulting instation is:
% D = 2
% E = 2

% (e) triangle( point(-1,0), P2, P3) = triangle( P1, point(1,0), point(0,Y) ).
% Successful. The resulting instation is:
% P1 = point(-1,0)
% P2 = point(1,0)
% P3 = point(0,Y)

% The family of triangles is all the isosceles triangles with their base being the segment
% between (-1,0) and (1,0) as (0,Y) is on the mediatrix of that segment

% Exercise 2.4

% seg( point( 5, Y1), point( 5, Y2) ).

% Exercise 2.5

% A rectangle is represented by the term rectangle( P1, P2, P3, P4) where the P's are the 
% vertices of the rectangle positively ordered. 

% The most general expressions for the four points can be written as
% P1 = point( X1, Y1).
% P2 = point( X2, Y2).
% P3 = point( X3, Y3).
% P4 = point( X4, Y4).

% Now it is defined the asked relation

% regular( rectangle( point( X1, Y1), point( X2, Y1), point(X2, Y3), point( X1, Y3) ) ).
