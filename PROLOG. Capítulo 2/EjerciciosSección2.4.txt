% QUESTION
% ?- big(X), dark(X).

% EXECUTION TRACE
% (1) Initial goal list: big(X), dark(X).
% (2) Scanning for a clause whose head matches the first goal.
%	Clause 1 found. big(bear). The goal list shrinks to dark(bear). 
% (3) Clause 7 found. Replace the goal by the body of clause 7, giving a new goal
%	New goal is black(bear).
% (4) No clause found. Backtracking. Undo instantiation. Seach below clause 7.
% 	Clause 8 is found. New goal is brown(bear).
% (5) Clause 4 found. Successful termination and the corresponding variable instantiation is:
% 	X = bear. 

% Prolog does more work in the other case, with different order
% ?- dark(x), big(X). does more work
